# Deprecation Warning: `url.parse()`

## Issue

You may see the following deprecation warning in your logs:

```
(node:4) [DEP0169] DeprecationWarning: `url.parse()` behavior is not standardized and prone to errors that have security implications. Use the WHATWG URL API instead.
```

## Cause

This warning is **not coming from your application code**. It's generated by a **transitive dependency** (a package that one of your dependencies uses). The most likely sources are:

1. **`parseurl` package** - Used by Express and other HTTP frameworks
2. **Vercel's runtime** - May use legacy URL parsing internally
3. **Other dependencies** - Any package that uses the legacy `url.parse()` API

## Impact

- **No functional impact** - This is a deprecation warning, not an error
- **No security risk** - Your code is not affected
- **Future compatibility** - The warning indicates that Node.js may remove `url.parse()` in a future version

## Solution

### Option 1: Wait for Dependencies to Update (Recommended)

The warning will disappear when your dependencies update to use the modern WHATWG URL API. This is the safest approach.

### Option 2: Suppress the Warning (Not Recommended)

If the warning is cluttering your logs, you can suppress it by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Suppress all deprecation warnings (not recommended)
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1

# Or suppress only this specific warning
NODE_OPTIONS="--no-deprecation"
```

**Note**: Suppressing warnings hides important information and is not recommended for production.

### Option 3: Remove Unused Dependencies

If you're not using `express` or `cors` directly, you can remove them:

```bash
npm uninstall express cors
```

However, they may be required by other packages, so test thoroughly after removal.

## Verification

To verify this warning is not from your code:

1. Search your codebase for `url.parse`:
   ```bash
   grep -r "url.parse" .
   ```

2. If no results, the warning is from a dependency.

## Status

- ✅ **No action required** - This is a known issue from dependencies
- ✅ **Application functionality is not affected**
- ✅ **Will be resolved when dependencies update**
